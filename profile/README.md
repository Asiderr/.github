## Hi there, we are Dasharo Team  üëã

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dasharo/.github/main/profile/images/dasharo-sygnet.png)

We are builing Dasharo open-source firmware distribution focusing on clean and
simple code, long-term maintenance, transparent validation, privacy-respecting
implementation, liberty for the owners, and trustworthiness for all.

Dasharo is registered trademark and product developed by
[3mdeb](https://github.com/3mdeb).

Dasharo and related product services improved over **150k Intel-based
platforms** and over **500k AMD-based platforms**. Together we contributed
almost **40k lines of code** to various embedded firmware open-source projects.
We also developed more than **20k lines of code** to support IBM POWER9-based
Raptor Engineering Talos II in coreboot, which we currently upstreaming.

Since **March, 2015** we provided to community **165** open-source firmware releases.

## Community importance

We beleive that friendly community and cooperation is key to build thriving
open-source firmware ecosystem. Because of that we would like to invite you to:

* [Dashro Matrix Community](https://matrix.to/#/#dasharo:matrix.org) - where we
  discuss recent news related to open-surce and closed firmware, help selecting
  hardware for porting and provide support for Dasharo open-source firmware
  distribution compatible hardware.
* [Dasharo OSF vPub](https://vpub.dasharo.com/) - 3-4 times a year we organize
  online party to discuss recent achievements in open-source firmware, open
  source hardware and open instruction set architecture. Feel free to check the
  website about recent vPub plans or subscribe to
  [newsletter](https://newsletter.3mdeb.com/subscription/0_K65I7ro).
* There are also upcoming Dasharo Community Calls, Virtual and Live Hackathons
  as well as Live Coding sessions. If you would like to be informed about such
  events and other Dasharo related updates feel free to sign up to our
  [newsletter](https://newsletter.3mdeb.com/subscription/wwL90UkXP).
* We also care about education in community by contributing to
  [OpenSecurityTraining2](https://ost2.fyi/). Feel free to check our courses
